After quite a few attempts, and a bit of researching and playing, my assessment of this particular project is that it reminds me of the evolution of the automobile.
In its early forms, the automobile was fairly accessible to its users, one could fairly readily obtain the tools and learn how to to upkeep the machine.
The modern automobile, however, is a technological marvel that requires experts with specialized tools, changing the smallest feature may well affect other features adversly, a great deal of knowledge and care is necessary. It is not a particularly user friendy beast, unless the underlying form is maintained by these skilled technicians and users do no more than drive from A to B.
